    "text": "The patient is here for a routine followup visit for his lymphoma and to receive his maintenance rituximab. \n1. Recurrent follicular cell lymphoma. His most recent relapse was in the large bowel. Routine surveillance colonoscopy with numerous biopsies showed polyps as well as a nodular mucosal area in the proximal ascending colon and in the cecum. Multiple biopsies revealed a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Removal of one of the polyps revealed a tubular adenoma. \nA. He initially presented with a mass in the large bowel in the early 1990s associated with diarrhea and iron-deficiency anemia. Biopsy of the mass was said to reveal large cell lymphoma and he was given chemotherapy at that time. He had a recurrence in date and was re-treated. \nB. In date, he had another recurrence with diffuse lymphadenopathy and weight loss. At that time, a lymph node biopsy was done and showed a low-grade follicular lymphoma. \nC. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in xxx done because of pancytopenia revealed a hypocellular marrow with normal trilineage hematopoiesis. Lymphoma in the marrow was noted as well. The cells in the marrow were CD5, CD20 and PAX5 positive. Cyclin D1 was negative as well as BCL6. BCL2 was positive. Flow revealed lymphoma cells which comprised 17% of the nucleated cells. FMC7 and CD10 were negative. Cytogenetics revealed a trisomy-12 with deletion of 13Q and TP53. There may have been an MDS-related clone of 20Q minus. \n2. Pancytopenia present since date. This was multifactorial secondary to MDS as well as lymphomatous involvement of the bone marrow. \n3. Asthma. \n4. Chronic renal insufficiency. \n5. Monoclonal gammopathy with 2 IgG monoclonal bands which were IgG kappa and IgG lambda, probably related to his underlying lymphoma. \n6. Increased PSA, followed by Urology. \nThe patient received 4 weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m2, completed in xxx. In xxx, he was started on maintenance Rituxan 375 mg/m2 every other month which he will receive for 2 years. \n\n1. Four cycles of fludarabine ending in date. \n2. Three cycles of fludarabine in date. \n3. Fludarabine in date. \n4. Six cycles of CHOP in date. \nAlbuterol inhaler, aspirin, fish oil, multivitamins, vitamin C, and vitamin D. \nname name returns for followup of his low-grade lymphoma. Unfortunately, for the last several weeks, he has had an upper respiratory tract infection associated with a cough productive of yellow sputum. He denies any fevers, night sweats or chills. He has had associated wheezing and dyspnea on exertion. He is slowly improving. \nOtherwise, he denies any new medications or hospitalizations. \nThe patient denies any current fevers, night sweats, chills, headache or visual blurring. He continues to have a productive cough and dyspnea on exertion. He denies any PND, orthopnea or peripheral edema. He denies any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. His appetite is good. He denies any diarrhea, constipation or GI bleeding. He denies any dysuria. He denies any increased bruising. He denies any heat or cold or known glucose intolerance. He denies any significant musculoskeletal pain or skin rash. \nNegative for lymphoma. \nThe patient's performance status is ECOG 0-1. He has been feeling poorly because of his upper respiratory tract infection which he is slowly recovering from. Usually, he is very active. He has a significant other and they do ballroom dancing. He lives independently and does all activities of daily living. \n\nThe patient is afebrile, blood pressure 151/93, pulse 83 and regular, and his weight is 87.6 kilograms which is stable. \nNo scleral icterus. Pharynx without lesions. \nSupple, no adenopathy, no supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy. \nClear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. \nRegular rhythm, no murmur heard. \nSoft, no hepatosplenomegaly, no abdominal masses, no inguinal adenopathy. \nNo peripheral edema, petechiae or ecchymosis. \nNo rashes. \nThe patient is alert and oriented. Strength is intact and gait normal. \nCBC revealed a white blood cell count of 6200 which is a little bit higher than he usually runs with 75.5 polys, 7.5 lymphs, 14.7 monos, 1.6 eos, 0.7 basophils, a platelet count of 166,000 which also has improved and a hemoglobin of 13.6 with hematocrit of 40.1 which has fallen slightly. MCV is 94.1. BUN is 17, creatinine is 1.12. AST is slightly elevated at 44 and ALT is elevated at 64. These had not been elevated in the past. \nname name is a 78-year-old male with: \n1. Recurrent follicular cell lymphoma for which the patient is receiving Rituxan. Most recently, it was found on surveillance colonoscopy. He was asymptomatic. He has tolerated the Rituxan without difficulty. He is due today for another maintenance dose. \n2. Large cell lymphoma which was his original lymphoma if the pathology is to be believed and this was in date. He is status post 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy. \n3. Asthma which is under reasonable control. \n4. Viral upper respiratory tract infection which he is slowly recovering from. \n\n1. I will hold the rituximab infusion today because of his upper respiratory tract infection and he will return in 2 weeks for this. He will return again in 2 months for another maintenance cycle of rituximab. \n2. I will see him in followup in 4 months and again write for the orders. All the orders have been written. He receives 375 mg/m2 intravenously after premedication with lorazepam, hydrocortisone, famotidine, Benadryl and acetaminophen. He tolerates the drug without difficulty. \n||||END_OF_RECORD \n",
